<h2>AI Depth Estimation Model Setup</h2>

<p>The SBS V2 stereoscopic conversion node leverages the powerful Depth-Anything-V2-Small AI model from Hugging Face for accurate depth map extraction and 3D perception. This advanced depth estimation technology will be downloaded automatically on first use, but if you encounter connectivity issues, you can manually install the depth perception model:</p>

<h3>Automatic AI Model Installation (Recommended)</h3>
<p>The depth estimation model will be downloaded automatically when you first use the SBS V2 node for 2D-to-3D conversion. This seamless setup requires an internet connection during the initial stereoscopic processing run.</p>

<h3>Manual Depth Model Installation</h3>
<p>If the automatic depth map extraction model download fails, follow these steps for manual installation of the 3D perception AI:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit the model card on Hugging Face: <a href="https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf">depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf</a></li>
  <li>Download the main model file directly: <a href="https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf/blob/main/model.safetensors">model.safetensors</a> (and any other required files from the repository)</li>
  <li>The plugin uses Hugging Face's transformers library for automatic model loading, which stores models in the standard cache directory:
    <pre>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--depth-anything--Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf/snapshots/[COMMIT_HASH]/</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Create this directory structure and place the downloaded model files there</li>
  <li>For the exact path, check your Hugging Face cache directory or look at error messages during failed automatic downloads which will show the expected path</li>
</ol>

<h3>3D Processing Dependencies</h3>
<p>For optimal stereoscopic image processing and depth-aware rendering, ensure you have these dependencies installed:</p>
<pre>
transformers>=4.51.0  # Required for AI depth estimation
torch>=2.0.0          # Neural network processing for 3D conversion
pillow                # Image processing for stereoscopic output
numpy                 # Numerical processing for depth maps
opencv-python         # Computer vision for 3D visualization
tqdm                  # Progress tracking for batch processing
</pre>
